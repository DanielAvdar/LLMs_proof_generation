Verifier result: ERROR_TIER: TIER1_THEOREM_CALL_SYNTAX_VIOLATION
Failure: Theorem <triangle_area_formula_common> variation id is not supplied. Expected dict_keys(['1']) but got None.
Your call: triangle_area_formula_common(A,C,B)
Please rewrite your response by adding the variation id as the first argument. For example: For variation 1: triangle_area_formula_common(1,A,C,B)

Model Answer:
RETRY_ANSWER:
80
RETRY_THEOREM_SEQUENCE:
1; triangle_area_formula_common(ACB); Polygon(ACB); ["Equal(AreaOfTriangle(ACB),Mul(HeightOfTriangle(ACB),LengthOfLine(CB),1/2))"]
